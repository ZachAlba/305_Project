We collect it by analyzing the authenticated users in Firebase. This data is located under the Authentication tab of the Firebase console. This will only tell us how many accounts are created, however, not unique users or if the accounts are currently active. 

***Retention Metric***
For retention, a specific metric that could be used to measure the effectiveness of seeing the effectiveness of the music recommendation feature is the 7-Day User Return Rate. It tracks the percentage of users who return to the app within 1 week after their initial visit. This metric focuses on short-term retention, giving a clear picture of how engaging the app is in the period immediately following the introduction of the personalized recommendation feature.
