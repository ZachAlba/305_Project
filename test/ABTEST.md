# A/B Testing

A/B Test Name: Enhanced Discovery Experience

User Story Number: 4

Metric (from the HEART grid): Engagement

Hypothesis: Users are not engaging deeply with the music discovery feature, potentially due to an interface that doesn't effectively highlight new and interesting content. By redesigning the discovery page to emphasize personalized recommendations and newly released music, we expect to see an increase in user engagement as reflected by time spent on the app and the frequency of user posts.

Problem: Data shows that users are not spending much time on the discovery page and are not interacting with new music suggestions.

Impact: If users engage more with personalized content, this should increase their time spent on the app and lead to more interactions, thereby enhancing the overall user engagement.

Experiment:
Setup: Implement two versions of the discovery page: the current version (Control) and the new personalized recommendation design (Variant).
Audience: Randomly assign 50% of existing users to the new design to measure the effect on users already familiar with the platform.
Rationale: Targeting existing users allows us to measure changes in behavior due to the new design, as these users have established usage patterns.
Tracking: Using Firebase Analytics, measure the time spent on the discovery page and the frequency of user posts about new music for both groups.

Variations: 
Control (A): The existing music discovery page.
Variant (B): A redesigned discovery page that features a more personalized approach to music recommendations and new releases.

Design Work:
Include mockups of both the current and proposed discovery page designs.
Highlight the differences in layout and how new elements are expected to attract and retain user attention.
