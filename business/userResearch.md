## Observation 1

- Observation Statement:
    The data suggests that users in the 15-25 age range, particularly males, are seeking a music-based social app that combines streaming features with social interaction and personalization.

- Supporting Data:
    A significant number of respondents listen to music for more than 20 hours a week, indicating a strong engagement with music as part of their daily routine.

    There is a recurring interest in features that allow for social connectivity, such as sharing playlists, seeing what friends are listening to, and discussing music.

    Users value privacy and want control over who can see their profiles and listening habits.

    
    Respondents show interest in app personalization, like customizable profiles and recommendations based on listening history.

    Several users have expressed interest in the ability to rate, review, and rank albums, similar to existing platforms for other media.

- Team Action (if any):
    Develop a feature set that enables users to connect with friends within the app and share their music experiences.

    Ensure privacy settings are robust and user-friendly, allowing users to feel comfortable with their level of public visibility.

    Personalization should be a core aspect of the app development, with algorithms tailored to suggest music based on user behavior and social circles.

    Consider integrating a system for rating and reviewing content to engage users and enrich the music discovery experience.
