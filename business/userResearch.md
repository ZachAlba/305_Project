## Observation 1

- Observation Statement:
    The data suggests that users in the 15-25 age range, particularly males, are seeking a music-based social app that combines streaming features with social interaction and personalization.

- Supporting Data:
    A significant number of respondents listen to music for more than 20 hours a week, indicating a strong engagement with music as part of their daily routine.

    There is a recurring interest in features that allow for social connectivity, such as sharing playlists, seeing what friends are listening to, and discussing music.

    Users value privacy and want control over who can see their profiles and listening habits.

    
    Respondents show interest in app personalization, like customizable profiles and recommendations based on listening history.

    Several users have expressed interest in the ability to rate, review, and rank albums, similar to existing platforms for other media.

- Team Action (if any):
    Develop a feature set that enables users to connect with friends within the app and share their music experiences.

    Ensure privacy settings are robust and user-friendly, allowing users to feel comfortable with their level of public visibility.

    Personalization should be a core aspect of the app development, with algorithms tailored to suggest music based on user behavior and social circles.

    Consider integrating a system for rating and reviewing content to engage users and enrich the music discovery experience.


## Observation 2

- Observation Statement: 
    A potential user mentioned that they would like to see a currently listened to feature.
- Supporting Data:
    A large percentage of people ranked wanting to connect with friends on this app as a 5. By adding this feature we would be able to create a way for people to easily share music with friends.
- Team Action (if any): 
    We can add a currently listened to feature or maybe add something called last played so users can see the most recent song their friends have heard. 

## Observation 3

- Observation Statement: Many different suggestions for new names for the app
- Supporting Data: In our user survey's there was a large portion who offered alternative names for the
    application. This suggests that people aren't necessarily convinced that our current name, SoundScribe, is an appropriate name for our application. 
- Team Action (if any): Brainstorm new name suggestions from users, as well as any new names our group comes 
    up with to decide if we can come up with a better name, or if we want to keep our current name.

## Observation 4

- Observation Statement:
Participants generally show positive attitudes towards connecting with friends on a music-based social app, as indicated by the majority of responses being favorable. There is also a notable interest in engaging in activities such as rating, reviewing, and ranking albums, although this interest varies among respondents.

- Supporting Data:
The responses to "How do you feel about being able to connect with your friends on a music-based social app?" are predominantly positive, with many respondents rating their enthusiasm at 4 out of a 5-point scale.
Engagement levels for rating, reviewing, and ranking albums show a mix of interest levels, with several respondents indicating a high likelihood (rating of 4 on a scale of 1 to 5) of participating in such activities.

- Team Action (if any):
Given the positive reception to the idea of connecting with friends and engaging with content on a music-based social app, the we should:

Implement and promote a user-friendly interface for rating, reviewing, and ranking albums to encourage active participation from users, considering that there's a good level of interest in these activities.
Consider conducting further research or a follow-up survey to identify specific features or improvements that can enhance user engagement and satisfaction, particularly among those who expressed lower interest levels or concerns about certain features.
