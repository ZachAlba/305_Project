# Code of Conduct

***Decisions*** 
Everyone takes turns discussing and then will make decisions based on the majority vote.

## Attendance 
The mandatory class and also Monday meetings. Three hours notice for missed meetings.
No make up work, we will send the meeting minutes.

## Assignments 
We will decide what needs to be done for the week each Monday. As long as the member communicates and comes up with a plan to complete the assignment it's fine, it also must not become a habit. For poorly done assignments we will provide feedback and maybe two people can work together to meet the group standards.

## Participation 
We plan out our goals every Monday. We can elect which part of the assignment we will work on. Updates on the progress during Thursday class meetings. No phones allowed to ensure everyone is focused on the project.

## Meeting Times and Locations/Mediums 
We will meet Mondays from 8-9 on Zoom

## Agenda and Minutes /Notes
Minutes will be done on a Google doc. We will rotate who writes them each week.

## Promptness 
Be on time. Commutation if late.

## Conversational Courtesies 
Respect is important, listening and engaging with each other's thoughts and ideas is a must.

## Enforcement/ Feedback 
As long as feedback is respectful and constructive it is encouraged.
