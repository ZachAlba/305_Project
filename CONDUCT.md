# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official email address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[INSERT CONTACT METHOD].
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

## Decisions 
Everyone takes turns discussing and then will make decisions based on the majority vote.

## Attendance 
The mandatory class and also Monday meetings. Three hours notice for missed meetings.
No make up work, we will send the meeting minutes.

## Assignments 
We will decide what needs to be done for the week each Monday. As long as the member communicates and comes up with a plan to complete the assignment it's fine, it also must not become a habit. For poorly done assignments we will provide feedback and maybe two people can work together to meet the group standards.

## Participation 
We plan out our goals every Monday. We can elect which part of the assignment we will work on. Updates on the progress during Thursday class meetings. 

## Meeting Times and Locations/Mediums 
We will meet Mondays from 8-9 on Zoom

## Agenda and Minutes /Notes
Minutes will be done on a Google doc. We will rotate who writes them each week.

## Promptness 
Be on time. Commutation if late.

## Conversational Courtesies 
Respect is important, listening and engaging with each other's thoughts and ideas is a must.

## Enforcement/ Feedback 
As long as feedback is respectful and constructive it is encouraged.
